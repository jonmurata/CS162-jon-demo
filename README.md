# CS162 Demos
Created by Jonathan Murata for the Spring 2019 offering of CS 162 at UC Berkeley.

Demos to be presented in CS 162 Discussion sections. Used to help visualize concepts, understand course material, and make discussion sections more interesting. Some demos should pair with the discussion worksheets.
